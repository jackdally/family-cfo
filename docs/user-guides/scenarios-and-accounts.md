# Scenarios & Accounts

## Scenarios
- A Scenario is the container for accounts and events. Create and manage scenarios at `/scenarios`.
- The default scenario is created automatically on first import.

## Accounts
- Accounts are financial buckets (checking, savings, brokerage, credit).
- View and create accounts at `/accounts`.
- Each account belongs to a Scenario and an owner (MVP uses `owner-dev`).

## Tips
- Use descriptive names for scenarios (e.g., "Baseline 2025", "Sabbatical Plan").
- Create separate accounts for credit to track negative balances distinctly.
