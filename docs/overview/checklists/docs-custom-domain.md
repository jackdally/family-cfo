# Checklist: Docs Custom Domain

- [ ] Decide domain (e.g., `docs.familycfo.com`)
- [ ] Add CNAME in repo Settings â†’ Pages
- [ ] Add DNS CNAME record pointing to `jackdally.github.io`
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS
- [ ] Update docs `url`/`baseUrl` if moving to a new path

Definition of done: docs served on the custom domain with HTTPS.
